# Contact_form
A user issues a GET request for a web page that contains a form.
The user fills in the form.
The user clicks the "Send" button, submitting it to the server via a POST request.
The server validates the information.
If one or more fields do not validate, the web page containing the form loads again with a helpful error message, prompting the user to try again.
If all fields validate, the form information is used in the next step in the pipeline.
